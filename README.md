<h1 align="center">Stripe for Craft Commerce</h1>

This plugin provides a [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) integration for [Craft Commerce](https://craftcms.com/commerce) supporting [Payment Intents](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-intents) and traditional charges.

## Requirements

- Craft CMS 3.1.5 or later
- Craft Commerce 2.2 or later
- Stripe [API version](https://stripe.com/docs/api/versioning) '2019-03-14'

## Installation

You can install this plugin from the Plugin Store or using Composer.

#### From the Plugin Store

Go to the Plugin Store in your project’s control panel, search for “Stripe for Craft Commerce”, and choose **Install** in the plugin’s modal window.

#### With Composer

Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
# go to the project directory
cd /path/to/my-project.test

# tell Composer to load the plugin
composer require craftcms/commerce-stripe

# tell Craft to install the plugin
php craft install/plugin commerce-stripe
```

## Changes in 2.0

We deprecated the original “Stripe” gateway as “Stripe Charge” and added a new “Stripe Payment Intents” gateway which uses Stripe’s [Payment Intents API](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-intents) and [3D Secure 2](https://stripe.com/guides/3d-secure-2), which is easier to implement than the old 3D Secure standard and delivers a better customer experience.

**Stripe began declining all EU charges using its old charge API on September 14, 2019,** so we highly recommend switching to the newer “Stripe Payment Intents” gateway. (Learn more by reading Stripe’s [Strong Customer Authentication](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication) guide.)

## Setup

To add the Stripe payment gateway in the Craft control panel, navigate to **Commerce** → **Settings** → **Gateways**, create a new gateway, and set the gateway type to “Stripe Payment Intents”.

> ⚠️ The deprecated “Stripe Charge” gateway is still available. See [Changes in 2.0](#changes-in-2-0).

In order for the gateway to work properly, the following settings are required:

- Publishable API Key
- Secret API Key

You can find these in your Stripe dashboard under **Developers** → **API keys**.

## Payment Process and Security

This plugin relies on stored payment methods and doesn’t allow directly-submitted credit card details. To check out, a customer must submit a `paymentMethodId` parameter to the Commerce `commerce/payments/pay` form action.

A new payment method can be created prior to checkout using Stripe’s front-end JavaScript API.

Check out Stripe’s [Create Payment Method](https://stripe.com/docs/js/payment_methods/create_payment_method) documentation to learn how to save a payment method or follow the [example below](#creating-a-stripe-payment-form-for-the-payment-intents-gateway).

## Webhooks

You’ll need to update configuration with this plugin and the Stripe dashboard in order to utilize webhooks.

### Configuring Stripe

Set up a webhook endpoint in your Stripe dashboard API settings. The URL for this endpoint can be found in your Commerce Stripe gateway settings.

We recommend emitting all possible events, but the required events are:

#### For 3D Secure Payments (if using Stripe Charge gateway)

- `source.cancelled`
- `source.chargeable`
- `source.failed`

#### For Subscriptions

- `invoice.payment_succeeded`
- `customer.subscription.deleted`

We strongly recommended enabling the following events to ensure your Commerce subscriptions stay in sync with your Stripe dashboard:

- `plan.deleted`
- `plan.updated`
- `invoice.created`
- `customer.subscription.updated`
- `invoice.payment_failed`

### Configuring the Gateway

When you've set up the endpoint, you can view the signing secret in its settings. Enter this value in your Stripe gateway settings in the Webhook Signing Secret field. To use webhooks, the Webhook Signing Secret setting is required.

## Configuration Settings

### `chargeInvoicesImmediately`

For subscriptions with automatic payments, Stripe creates an invoice 1-2 hours before attempting to charge it. By setting this to `true` in your `commerce-stripe.php` config file, you can force Stripe to charge this invoice immediately.

This setting affects all Stripe gateways on your Commerce installation.

### The `allowSubscriptionWithoutPaymentMethod` setting

Normally, this plugin will not allow a subscription to be created if the customer has no payment methods in Stripe. By setting this to true in your `commerce-stripe.php` config file, a customer can create a subscription without any payment information. This is useful for trial subscription flows where you do not wish to take payment information up front.

This setting affect all Stripe gateways on your Commerce installation.

## Subscriptions

### Creating a Subscription Plan

1. Every subscription plan must first be [created in the Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/subscriptions/products).
2. In the Craft control panel, navigate to **Commerce** → **Settings** → **Subscription plans** and create a new subscription plan.

### Subscribe Options

#### `trialDays`

When subscribing, you can pass a `trialDays` parameter. The first full billing cycle will start once the number of trial days lapse. Default value is `0`.

### Cancel Options

#### `cancelImmediately`

If this parameter is set to `true`, the subscription is canceled immediately. Otherwise, it is marked to cancel at the end of the current billing cycle. Defaults to `false`.

### Plan-Switching Options

#### `prorate`

If this parameter is set to `true`, the subscription switch will be [prorated](https://stripe.com/docs/subscriptions/upgrading-downgrading#understanding-proration). Defaults to `false`.

#### `billImmediately`

If this parameter is set to `true`, the subscription switch is billed immediately. Otherwise, the cost (or credit, if `prorate` is set to `true` and switching to a cheaper plan) is applied to the next invoice.

> ⚠️ If the billing periods differ, the plan switch will be billed immediately and this parameter will be ignored.

## Events

The plugin provides several events you can use to modify the behavior of your integration.

### Payment Request Events

#### `buildGatewayRequest`

Plugins get a chance to provide additional metadata to any request that is made to Stripe in the context of paying for an order. This includes capturing and refunding transactions.

There are some restrictions:

- Changes to the `Transaction` model available as the `transaction` property will be ignored;
- Changes to the `order_id`, `order_number`, `transaction_id`, `client_ip`, and `transaction_reference` metadata keys will be ignored;
- Changes to the `amount`, `currency` and `description` request keys will be ignored;

```php
use craft\commerce\models\Transaction;
use craft\commerce\stripe\events\BuildGatewayRequestEvent;
use craft\commerce\stripe\base\Gateway as StripeGateway;
use yii\base\Event;

Event::on(
    StripeGateway::class,
    StripeGateway::EVENT_BUILD_GATEWAY_REQUEST,
    function(BuildGatewayRequestEvent $e) {
        /** @var Transaction $transaction */
        $transaction = $e->transaction;
        
        if ($transaction->type === 'refund') {
            $e->request['someKey'] = 'some value';
        }
    }
);
```

#### `receiveWebhook`

Plugins get a chance to do something whenever a webhook is received. This event will be fired regardless of whether or not the gateway has done something with the webhook.

```php
use craft\commerce\stripe\events\ReceiveWebhookEvent;
use craft\commerce\stripe\base\Gateway as StripeGateway;
use yii\base\Event;

Event::on(
    StripeGateway::class,
    StripeGateway::EVENT_RECEIVE_WEBHOOK,
    function(ReceiveWebhookEvent $e) {
        if ($e->webhookData['type'] == 'charge.dispute.created') {
            if ($e->webhookData['data']['object']['amount'] > 1000000) {
                // Be concerned that a USD 10,000 charge is being disputed.
            }
        }
    }
);
```

### Subscription Events

#### `createInvoice`

Plugins get a chance to do something when an invoice is created on the Stripe gateway.

```php
use craft\commerce\stripe\events\CreateInvoiceEvent;
use craft\commerce\stripe\base\SubscriptionGateway as StripeGateway;
use yii\base\Event;

Event::on(
    StripeGateway::class, 
    StripeGateway::EVENT_CREATE_INVOICE,
    function(CreateInvoiceEvent $e) {
        if ($e->invoiceData['billing'] === 'send_invoice') {
            // Forward this invoice to the accounting department.
        }
    }
);
```

#### `beforeSubscribe`

Plugins get a chance to tweak subscription parameters when subscribing.

```php
use craft\commerce\stripe\events\SubscriptionRequestEvent;
use craft\commerce\stripe\base\SubscriptionGateway as StripeGateway;
use yii\base\Event;

Event::on(
    StripeGateway::class,
    StripeGateway::EVENT_BEFORE_SUBSCRIBE,
    function(SubscriptionRequestEvent $e) {
        $e->parameters['someKey'] = 'some value';
        unset($e->parameters['unneededKey']);
    }
);
```

### Deprecated Events

The following event is deprecated because it’s associated with the deprecated Stripe Charge gateway.

#### `receive3dsPayment`

Plugins get a chance to do something whenever a successful 3D Secure payment is received.

```php
use craft\commerce\Plugin as Commerce;
use craft\commerce\stripe\events\Receive3dsPaymentEvent;
use craft\commerce\stripe\gateways\Gateway as StripeGateway;
use yii\base\Event;

Event::on(
    StripeGateway::class,
    StripeGateway::EVENT_RECEIVE_3DS_PAYMENT,
    function(Receive3dsPaymentEvent $e) {
        $order = $e->transaction->getOrder();
        $paidStatus = Commerce::getInstance()->getOrderStatuses()->getOrderStatusByHandle('paid');
        if ($order && $paidStatus && $order->orderStatusId !== $paidStatus->id && $order->getIsPaid()) {
            $order->orderStatusId = $paidStatus->id;
            Craft::$app->getElements()->saveElement($order);
        }
    }
);
```

## Creating a Stripe Payment Form for the Payment Intents Gateway

You can output a standard form quickly using `order.gateway.getPaymentFormHtml()` or `gateway.getPaymentFormHtml()`, but you can take a little bit more time to follow these steps and have more control over the resulting template.

### 1. Include Stripe’s JavaScript on your payment page.

```
<script src="https://js.stripe.com/v3/"></script>
```

> 💡 See the [Stripe JS documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/js) for more on using the Stripe JavaScript libraries and Stripe Elements front end tools we’re using below.

### 2. Create the HTML wrapper for Stripe’s inputs.

We only need a few specific IDs in our markup, and Stripe’s JavaScript will take care of the rest by inserting and managing form inputs.

Replace the `YOUR_GATEWAY_ID` below with your Stripe Payment Intents gateway ID.
(You can omit the `gatewayId` input if the gateway is already saved to the cart.)

```twig
<form method="post" action="" id="payment-form">
    {{ actionInput('commerce/payments/pay') }}
    {{ redirectInput(siteUrl('shop/customer/order', { number: cart.number, success: 'true' })) }}
    {{ hiddenInput('cancelUrl', siteUrl('shop/checkout/payment')|hash) }}
    {{ hiddenInput('gatewayId', 'YOUR_GATEWAY_ID') }}
    {{ csrfInput() }}

    <div class="form-row">
        <label for="card-element">
            Credit or debit card input fields
        </label>
        <div id="card-element">
            {# Stripe’s JavaScript will insert Stripe Elements here #}
        </div>
        {# Used to display form errors #}
        <div id="card-errors" role="alert"></div>
    </div>

    <button id="submit-button" type="submit">Submit Payment</button>
</form>
```

### 3. Instantiate the Stripe JS library with your gateway’s `publishableKey`.

Create the `stripe` object in your page’s JavaScript:

```javascript
var stripe = Stripe('{{ parseEnv(cart.gateway.publishableKey) }}');
```

This expects the Stripe gateway to be set on the order. If you’re setting it on the order during the payment submission, you would need to get a reference to the gateway first:

```twig
{% set gateway = craft.commerce.gateways.getGatewayById('YOUR_GATEWAY_ID') %}
```

Then you could instantiate the `stripe` object using `gateway.publishableKey`:

```javascript
var stripe = Stripe('{{ parseEnv(gateway.publishableKey) }}');
```

Once you have a `stripe` object, you need to create an instance of Stripe Elements:

```javascript
// Create an instance of Elements
var elements = stripe.elements();
```

### 4. Create a styled card instance.

Set some style attributes for the card element we’ll create:

```javascript
var style = {
  base: {
    color: '#32325d',
    fontFamily: '"Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, sans-serif',
    fontSmoothing: 'antialiased',
    fontSize: '16px',
    '::placeholder': {
      color: '#aab7c4'
    }
  },
  invalid: {
    color: '#fa755a',
    iconColor: '#fa755a'
  }
};
```

Create the cart instance using those styles:

```javascript
// Create an instance of the card Element
var card = elements.create('card', { style: style });
```

Mount that card into our markup’s ` <div id="card-element">` we created earlier:

```javascript
card.mount('#card-element');
```

To handle real-time validation errors from the card Element, we’ll add error messages to our markup’s `<div id="card-errors" role="alert"></div>`:

```javascript
card.on('change', function(event) {
    var displayError = document.getElementById('card-errors');
    if (event.error) {
        displayError.textContent = event.error.message;
    } else {
        displayError.textContent = '';
    }
});
```

Finally, add a form listener that uses the submitted card details to [create a payment method](https://stripe.com/docs/js/payment_methods/create_payment_method) and pass in optional billing details:

```javascript
var form = document.getElementById('payment-form');

form.addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
    event.preventDefault();

    var paymentData = {
        billing_details: {
            email: "{{ cart.email }}",
        }
    };

    stripe.createPaymentMethod('card', card, paymentData).then(function(result) {
        if (result.error) {
            // Show the user any errors
            var errorElement = document.getElementById('card-errors');
            errorElement.textContent = result.error.message;
        } else {
            // Insert the token ID into the form so it gets submitted to the server
            var form = document.getElementById('payment-form');
            var hiddenInput = document.createElement('input');
            hiddenInput.setAttribute('type', 'hidden');
            hiddenInput.setAttribute('name', 'paymentMethodId'); // Craft Commerce only needs this
            hiddenInput.setAttribute('value', result.paymentMethod.id);
            form.appendChild(hiddenInput);

            form.submit();
        }
    });
});
```
